This is a tree-walk interpreter (jlox) that closely follows the [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) book. I've made some tweaks and done some of the challenges, but it's mostly a learning exercise and not anything new.

For something more original, I am working on a [Zig port](https://github.com/jacob-horton/zlox-bytecode-vm) of clox!
